README for E-commerce Product Recommendation System

Introduction

This repository contains a machine learning model designed for an e-commerce product recommendation system. The model utilizes a content-based filtering approach, which leverages user interests and past activities to suggest products tailored to individual preferences. This README provides an overview of the project, including its objectives, dataset features, methodologies employed, and instructions for usage.

Project Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust recommendation system that enhances user experience by providing personalized product suggestions. By analyzing user behavior and product attributes, the system aims to increase engagement and conversion rates on e-commerce platforms.

Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project consists of a comprehensive collection of features relevant to e-commerce products. Key features include:

Product ID
Product Name
Category
Description
Price
User Ratings
User Purchase History
These features are instrumental in building an effective content-based recommendation system as they provide insights into both product characteristics and user preferences.

Methodologies Used

In this project, three different regression techniques were implemented to predict user preferences based on the available data:

Linear Regression: This method was employed to establish a linear relationship between the input features (product attributes) and the target variable (user ratings or purchase likelihood). Linear regression is straightforward and interpretable, making it suitable for initial modeling efforts.

Support Vector Machine (SVM): SVM was utilized for its ability to handle high-dimensional spaces effectively. It works by finding the hyperplane that best separates different classes in the feature space. In this context, SVM helps in classifying products based on user preferences derived from their historical interactions.

Random Forest Regressor: This ensemble learning method combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and control overfitting. The Random Forest Regressor aggregates predictions from various trees, leading to more reliable recommendations by capturing complex relationships within the data.- 

**Conclusion**

This e-commerce product recommendation system demonstrates how machine learning techniques can be applied to enhance user experience through personalized suggestions. By utilizing linear regression, support vector machines, and random forest regressors, we aim to provide accurate recommendations tailored to individual usersâ€™ needs.
